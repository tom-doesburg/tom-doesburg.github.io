    <h2>Sprint Two + Five - My Learning Plan (updated)</h2>
    <strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong>

    <p>I have done a lot of thinking about this during the past week. I am a
    visual person; I have a love of photography and making music. I would like
    to be able to make what ever ideas I have in my head. In the bootcamp I
    want to learn how to code and think like a programmer. Understanding the
    full stack will be very useful. After the bootcamp, I will focus on design
    and mastering photoshop in my spare time. Eventually, a career such as a
    UI/UX designer or product designer interests me. I like working with people
    and I like being creative (when I have enough time). My technical skills
    are lacking and that is why I’m here.</p>
    <br>
    <strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
    Bootcamp?</strong>

    <p>I believe my strengths have stayed the same. However, I have discovered
    that staying focussed is still a weakness, although I am making progress. I
    think the limitations for me will be learning JavaScript, I just don’t feel
    confident in my ability to translate pseudocode in to actual code.</p>
    <br>
    <strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
    will be?</strong>

    <p>I did the entire foundation course remotely as I needed to manage a few
    different things that are going on in my life. The bootcamp will be my
    first experience working with my cohort (other than using zoom/slack). My
    biggest challenge will be asking questions. I don’t like wasting peoples
    time, but sometimes asking a lot of questions can be very useful and save a
    lot of time in the long run.</p>
    <br>
    <strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
    developed in yourself while at EDA?</strong>

    <p>I would really like to develop my leadership skills further. I have been
    working on these the last few years and I think there is still a lot of
    room for improvement. I would also like to improve my communication skills.
    Being able to communicate clearly and effectively without being ambiguous,
    this is what I am aiming for.</p>
    <br>
    <strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong>

    <p>My expectations are that there is a lot of patience and clear
    explanations on what is required. Any support in terms of helping me
    achieve my longer term career goals would be much appreciated.</p>
    <br>
    <strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</strong>

    <p>Full focus and a lot of hard work. I am going to really give this all my
    time and energy for 9 weeks. By the end of the bootcamp, I want to feel
    confident in my coding skills enough to land me a job.</p>
    <br>
    <strong>Statement of Commitment</strong>

    <p>I will be consistent, hard working and clear in communication. I will
    ask good questions and embrace working in a team with a positive attitude.
    I will give this my full time and energy to really get the most out of the
    learning experience. I will do all of the above by making sure I structure
    my days efficiently in regards to study but also take time to rest and keep
    fit and healthy</p>
    <br>


    <p>My long term goal is to become a developer that can work on projects
    remotely. I have a particular interest in working on and designing products
    and I would like to be involved in their original conception. Having the
    ability to know how to code will enable me to get hands on in the
    development. Specifically, application design is where I would like to end
    up, although I need to work on my design skills. I also really enjoy the
    UI/UX side of things. I am hoping to combine all these aspects in to a
    future career.</p>
    <br>


    <p>I would like to work on my communication skills, in particular, pitching
    an idea in order to gain support. I feel that this is a very advantageous
    skill to have but it can very difficult to do in a way that is clear and
    convincing. Being articulate and engaging is important here.</p>
    <br>


    <p>I am very resourceful and I can see the big picture. I have strong
    interpersonal skills, empathetic and a great listener. I am resilient and I
    don’t give up when I face challenges. My limitations are that I can get
    distracted and take a lot more time than I originally anticipated to get
    things done. I can work for hours on end but getting started can be the
    hard part.</p>
    <br>


    <p>The key ingredient to managing my workload is to be consistent. Regular
    hours, with regular breaks that are bracketed with regular activities
    (running, music, reading). This will help me stay on track and give me some
    routine. I think achieving lots of little wins each day (breaking down
    larger goals in to smaller ones) will help motivate me.</p>


    <p><br>
    </p>


    <p>Communication is key when working with others. I think being clear and
    confident about what I am trying to achieve as part of the team, and what
    my role is as a team member is very important.</p>
    <br>


    <p>When I need help, I will ask. It is easy to ask questions, via slack,
    phone or email. I have no problems asking for help when I need it. However,
    I don’t like asking for help early. I like to really explore a challenge
    before asking for help because from experience the answer is just around
    the corner if you are persistent.</p>
    <br>


    <p>I expect the facilitation team is there to help when I need it. I expect
    them to be reliable, accessible and honest. I like criticism as it can help
    me get to where I want to be faster. I expect constructive criticism from
    the facilitation team.</p>
    <br>


    <p>For foundations, my timetable is based around work in the
    afternoons/evenings. 1pm – 9pm. This enables me to go for a run in the
    morning and prepare for the day or work ahead. I also have left time in the
    weekends to explore a topic further. I would rather do something everyday
    than take complete days off.</p>
    <br>


    <p>In summary, my learning plan is to take advantage of all the information
    that is being taught at EDA and really push myself to understand as much as
    possible. I would like to have a portfolio by the end of the course in
    order to showcase my skills.</p>
