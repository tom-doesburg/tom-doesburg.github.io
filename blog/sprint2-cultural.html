    <h2>Sprint Two - My Learning Plan</h2>                   
    <p> 
    My long term goal is to become a developer that can work on projects remotely. 
    I have a particular interest in working on and designing products and I would
    like to be involved in their original conception. Having the ability to know how 
    to code will enable me to get hands on in the development. Specifically, 
    application design is where I would like to end up, although I need to work
    on my design skills. I also really enjoy the UI/UX side of things.
    I am hoping to combine all these aspects in to a future career.
    </P>

    I would like to work on my communication skills, in particular, pitching an idea
    in order to gain support. I feel that this is a very advantageous skill to have but
    it can very difficult to do in a way that is clear and convincing.
    Being articulate and engaging is important here.
    </P>
    <br>

    I am very resourceful and I can see the big picture. I have strong interpersonal skills,
    empathetic and a great listener. I am resilient and I don’t give up when I face challenges.
    My limitations are that I can get distracted and take a lot more time than I originally
    anticipated to get things done. I can work for hours on end but getting started can be the hard part.
    </P>

    The key ingredient to managing my workload is to be consistent. Regular hours, with regular breaks that
    are bracketed with regular activities (running, music, reading). This will help me stay on track and give me some routine.
    I think achieving lots of little wins each day (breaking down larger goals in to smaller ones) will help motivate me.
    <P>

    Communication is key when working with others. I think being clear and confident about what I am trying to achieve as part 
    of the team, and what my role is as a team member is very important. 
    </P>
    <br>
    <P>
    When I need help, I will ask. It is easy to ask questions, via slack, phone or email. I have no problems asking for help when
    I need it. However, I don’t like asking for help early. I like to really explore a challenge before asking for help because from
    experience the answer is just around the corner if you are persistent.
    </P>
    <br>
    <P>       
    I expect the facilitation team is there to help when I need it. I expect them to be reliable, accessible and honest.
    I like criticism as it can help me get to where I want to be faster. I expect constructive criticism from the facilitation team.
    </P>

    For foundations, my timetable is based around work in the afternoons/evenings. 1pm – 9pm. This enables me to go for a run in the morning
    and prepare for the day or work ahead. I also have left time in the weekends to explore a topic further.
    I would rather do something everyday than take complete days off.
    </P>
    <br>
    <P>
    In summary, my learning plan is to take advantage of all the information that is being taught at EDA and really push myself to understand as much
    as possible. I would like to have a portfolio by the end of the course in order to showcase my skills.
