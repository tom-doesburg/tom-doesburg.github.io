    <h2>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS
    </h2>
    <p>
    I found an interesting picture on Instagram the other day which displayed the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript very clearly. 
    It shows HTML being the skeleton, CSS being the clothes, the skin etc.. and JavaScript being the nerves and muscles.

    <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h2>
    <p>
    Flow is like a grocery list. You go through the list acquiring what you need in order to fill your fridge and pantry.  A loop is like a decision you need to make when deciding which brand to buy so that you can continue shopping. For example, the grocery list says chocolate but do I buy Whitakers or Cadbury chocolate? The loop has certain requests, or parameters that help make the “best” decision. Is this chocolate tasty? Is this chocolate healthy? Will my partner like this brand? It maybe that you take the chocolate home to show your partner and they don’t like. You then loop back to the start and go through the process again. Eventually the loop will complete and you will add the chosen chocolate to your basket. When you have finished shopping and everything is in your fridge and pantry all the flow processes has been executed.

    <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a document which displays all the information of your website in a layout that is easy to navigate. It’s like a map which displays the locations of your HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can easily pinpoint where you want to go, or look, in order to change, test, identify and discover certain information. The document is ordered in a tree structure which has different nodes. In these nodes, the different elements are located.

    <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
    </h2>
    <p>
        An Array is a single variable that contain multiple values.
        For example, 
        var bodyParts = [“hand”, “arm”, “shoulder”];
        Arrays are a good way to organise a lot of information when order is the most important factor.
        The strings in the array always start at 0. So “hand” would be 0 and “shoulder” would be 2.
        If I wanted to access index [1] in the bodyParts array, I would write:
        bodyParts[1]
        and I would get a return value of:
        “arm”
        Objects are like different sections of a library. If you want to find the history section of the library, you can look at the sign and quickly go to where all the history books are. You can then easily go to different sections of the library in order to find a whole lot of information on different labels or “genres”. Objects are organised data based on labels. Almost everything in JavaScript is an object.
        To access data in an object we use:
        Library[‘history’]
        or 
        library.history
    </p>
    <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
    </h2>
    <p>
    Functions are a block of code designed to do certain processes. Imagine it like seeing a new email in your inbox. When you click on an unread email it opens up and you can see all the information within it. A function is like an unread email. Technically, they are useful for executing multiple tasks which have been set. This can save time and keep things clear and relatively simple.
