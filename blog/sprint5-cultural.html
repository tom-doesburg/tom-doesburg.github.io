    <h2>Sprint Five - Reflections</h2>


    <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego
    as a result of the core learning?</h3>


    <p>I have learnt that I need to practice remaining focussed and I need to
    have good systems in place in order to work efficiently. I have learnt that
    when my inner voice is telling me that “I can’t do it”, I need to push on
    and there is a breakthrough just around the corner. I have learnt that when
    I am in my flow I can get a lot of work done. This helps my ego in terms of
    reminding me that I can do.</p>


    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>


    <p>I was surprised by how much studying about learning helped me understand
    the course material.</p>


    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>


    <p>I was surprised by how much I didn’t know about myself. I really had to
    think about my identity and values.</p>


    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
    focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>


    <p>It’s because it adds to making a more well rounded worker. From
    experience, you need to use all these skills in a work environment. It’s
    not just about having technical skills it’s about having human skills as
    well.</p>


    <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
    of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming
    instead? Justify your answer.</h3>


    <p>I do think that I need to improve my programming skills before bootcamp
    starts. However, I definitely don’t think the time spent on core learning
    was a waste. I am more efficient and I know how to deal with obstacles from
    having spent time studying core learning.</p>
