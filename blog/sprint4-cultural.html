        Sprint Four - Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
      </h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is largely centred around forming strong neural connections in the brain. These connections are strengthened by repeated behaviour which tie in to forming strong habits. The idea that the brain can change replaced the original thinking that the brain was static and it stopped being able to develop after certain developmental periods. It is true that a child’s brain is a lot more malleable, however, that doesn’t stop as you get older. You can contain to change your brain all throughout your life.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit
      </h3>
      <p>
        By understanding that I can continue to learn as I get older, gives me confidence in tackling a subject I know little about. It will help reduce blocks and limitations I have within myself.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I can increase neuroplasticity by doing some of the following things: Have enough sleep. This is important so that the brain can reset brain connections that are important for memory and learning. Continue learning. Forming good habits and repetition of exercises are important to form strong neural pathways. Reduce stress. Reduce stress by doing things like exercise and meditation. This helps the brain work at a more optimum level.

      <h3>What is growth mindset and why it is relevant?</h3>
      <p>
        Growth mindset is about knowing that you can get smarter by putting the time and effort in. Therefore, anyone can achieve growth by understanding that there is no difference in the ability to learn. This leads to more confidence and higher achievement.
      </p>
      <h3>
        In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
      </h3>
      <p>
        When reading about growth mindset, I thought that I already had a growth mindset. This definition seemed to fit me very well,
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>“Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts).”</em><br>
    </p>  
    <p>    
    Then I read this,
    </p>
    <p>    
    <em>“I already have it, and I always have; People often confuse a growth mindset with being flexible or open-minded or with having a positive outlook —&nbsp;qualities they believe they’ve simply always had. My colleagues and I call this a false growth mindset. Everyone is actually a mixture of fixed and growth mindsets, and that mixture continually evolves with experience. A “pure” growth mindset doesn’t exist,&nbsp;which we have to acknowledge in order to attain the benefits we seek.”</em><br>
    </p>
    <p>Knowing the antithesis helps me know what I don’t want to do in case I start leaning towards the “fixed” growth mindset.
    </p>
      <h3>
        How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will make sure that I remember that as long as I continue to do something, I will head towards my goal. I want to learn and I want to get better but I understand there are ups and downs along the way.
      </p>
