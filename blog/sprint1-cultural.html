    <strong>Ethical Decisions:</strong>
    Making ethical decisions is a big part of my personality type (according to Myers Briggs). As an INFP, I have a very strong moral compass and I feel things deeply. The Myers Briggs test is pretty spot on when it comes to my personality and I have definitely made unethical decisions in the past which has made me feel terrible. Weighing up the pros and cons of a decision is ultimately based on what you want and what you desire. In fact, you might know that your decision is unethical but you make it anyway. However, I believe that it is important to always try and make ethical decisions as they take courage and they are the very essence of being human.

    <strong>Cultural Influences:</strong>
    I was born in Wellington but when I was younger I lived in Holland for a few years. My fathers side of the family is of Dutch heritage and I would say that I have been influenced by the European culture of food, language, travel and history. However, I spent most of my time growing up in Lower Hutt. This is where I made the majority of my friends and l would consider myself to be very Kiwi. In New Zealand we are so lucky to be isolated and this gives our country a real sense of community. Being laid back, having a sense of adventure, working hard and being friendly to everyone. These are some of the cultural traits that identify me and New Zealand culture in general.

    <strong>Strengths and Limitations:</strong>
    I consider myself to be loyal, genuine and curious. I have a creative and technical side plus the desire to learn. These are my strengths but there are also limitations. For example, setting expectations is something that I need to work on. I can be a little too laid back and I like things to be relaxed and easy. I have realised that setting expectations can help everyone know where you stand and it means people don’t get down. This is a work in progress for me and one that I am enjoying getting better at.

    <strong>Working Life</strong>
    I have always enjoyed the process of working with people. I like engaging with people and forming professional relationships. I have found that recognition is a very important part of getting people to work well together. People like to know they are doing a good job, or at least be acknowledged when something good has been done. It’s very easy to say, “Hey, well done fixing that problem yesterday, that was good work”. Praising is a quality I feel is a strength of mine and something I always try to bring in to a workplace.
