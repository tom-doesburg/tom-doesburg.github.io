      How to write a pseudocode
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. Start by writing down the purpose of the process. 2. Write initial steps of pseudo code that set the stage for functions. 3. Write functional pseudo code. 4. Add comments, if necessary. 5. Read over the finished project for logic errors . 6. Review the pseudo code.

      The rubber ducky method
    </h2>
    <p>
      When you explain something to something or somebody that doesn’t understand it you can deconstruct what you are trying to understand which helps you understand what the problem is.

      Reading error messages
    </h2>
    <p>
      I found this video really useful in understanding how to read error messages. Or at least the process on what to do when one shows up.

      Console.logging
    </h2>
    <p>
      A console is a sandbox, or testing ground, where you can test your code to see if it works.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Google Chrome you can access the console by pressing Ctrl Shift J you can access the console by clicking on&nbsp;Ctrl Shift J on a PC or Cmd Alt J on a Mac.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can display things in the console by using console.log
    </p>
    <p>
      Below are examples of calling different things: numbers: console.log(1234); or characters:console.log("a,b,c"); Or declared variables:console.log(myAge);

    <h2>
      Googling
    </h2>
    <p>
      Googling is the best resource. You can find videos, articles, blogs and comments. There is so much information out there. Being able to discern the good information from the bad is the hard part, which leads in to the next topic.

    <h2>
      Trying something
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have used this technique many a time and it has worked. Sometimes, you don’t know what you really did, but it just worked, magic! Ideally, you want to know what you are doing otherwise you could break something pretty badly. When you are stuck, trying something might fix the problem or at least send you on a new path of discovery.

    <h2>
      Asking your peers for help
    </h2>
    <p>
      Asking good questions is important when you ask for help. You don’t want to waste the time of the people you are asking for help. I think it’s best to explore all you can yourself before asking for help.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Asking coaches for help
    </h2>
    <p>
      Similar to asking your peers for help. Asking your coaches for help when you have a problem can really help. Except, you want to ask good questions and not waste time until you have explored the problem yourself.

    <h2>
      Improving your process with reflection
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am big fan of this. Reflecting, but not too much, find a time for it each day. Go and stand outside with a cup of tea and think about what you are doing. Go for a run and think about what you need to do. Go hiking... let those processes in your brain run themselves out of energy and then you are ready to go with a solid plan!
