        <p>Hi, my name is Tom Doesburg and I am from Wellington. Up until this year I had been living in France teaching English and before that I was a musician working on cruise ships. I have also spent quite a few years working in tech, in jobs that were not really that interesting. I am here because I want to learn how to code and gain some practical skills which will help me begin a new and exciting career in tech.
                I enjoy travelling, photography, meeting people and writing and playing music. I like to keep busy and I look forward to getting to know all of you over the next few months.
