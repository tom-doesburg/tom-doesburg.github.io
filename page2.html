    <strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong>    
    <p>    
        Emotional Intelligence or EQ, is the ability to know your own emotions and understand the emotions of others. 
        This helps guide decision making and helps to really connect with people on an emotional level. 
        Knowing what somebody is feeling can help us understand of what they are thinking.     
    </p>
    <br>
    <strong>How is it different to IQ?</strong>    
    <p>
        IQ is about your logical reasoning, reading comprehension, mathematical and abstract thinking ability.
        Generally, IQ is based more on memory and the ability to learn, understand and apply information.
    </p>
    <br>
    <strong>Why is it important?</strong>
    <p>
        Emotional intelligence is important as it helps create strong connections with people. 
        High EQ is important when working in teams and in leadership roles. As human beings, we all share the same emotions and being able to identify other peoples emotions means that you can adjust your own behaviour and adapt emotionally to what is in front of you.

        <h5>Sprint 2</h5>
      </br>

        <p> 
            My long term goal is to become a developer that can work on projects remotely. 
            I have a particular interest in working on and designing products and I would
            like to be involved in their original conception. Having the ability to know how 
            to code will enable me to get hands on in the development. Specifically, 
            application design is where I would like to end up, although I need to work
            on my design skills. I also really enjoy the UI/UX side of things.
            I am hoping to combine all these aspects in to a future career.
        </p>    
      </br>
        <p> I would like to work on my communication skills, in particular, pitching an idea
            in order to gain support. I feel that this is a very advantageous skill to have but
            it can very difficult to do in a way that is clear and convincing.
            Being articulate and engaging is important here.
          </p>
        </br>  
        <p>
            I am very resourceful and I can see the big picture. I have strong interpersonal skills,
            empathetic and a great listener. I am resilient and I don’t give up when I face challenges.
            My limitations are that I can get distracted and take a lot more time than I originally
            anticipated to get things done. I can work for hours on end but getting started can be the hard part.
          </p>  
            <br>

           <p> 
            The key ingredient to managing my workload is to be consistent. Regular hours, with regular breaks that
            are bracketed with regular activities (running, music, reading). This will help me stay on track and give me some routine.
            I think achieving lots of little wins each day (breaking down larger goals in to smaller ones) will help motivate me.
          </p>
            <br>
          <p>  
            Communication is key when working with others. I think being clear and confident about what I am trying to achieve as part 
            of the team, and what my role is as a team member is very important. 
          </p>
            <br>
          <p>  
            When I need help, I will ask. It is easy to ask questions, via slack, phone or email. I have no problems asking for help when
            I need it. However, I don’t like asking for help early. I like to really explore a challenge before asking for help because from
            experience the answer is just around the corner if you are persistent.
          </p>  
            <br>
          <p>  
            I expect the facilitation team is there to help when I need it. I expect them to be reliable, accessible and honest.
            I like criticism as it can help me get to where I want to be faster. I expect constructive criticism from the facilitation team.
          </p>
            <br>
          <p> 
            For foundations, my timetable is based around work in the afternoons/evenings. 1pm – 9pm. This enables me to go for a run in the morning
            and prepare for the day or work ahead. I also have left time in the weekends to explore a topic further.
            I would rather do something everyday than take complete days off.
          </p>
            <br>
          <p>  
            In summary, my learning plan is to take advantage of all the information that is being taught at EDA and really push myself to understand as much
            as possible. I would like to have a portfolio by the end of the course in order to showcase my skills.

              <strong>Ethical Decisions:</strong>
          </br>
              Making ethical decisions is a big part of my personality type (according to Myers Briggs). As an INFP, I have a very strong moral compass and I feel things deeply. The Myers Briggs test is pretty spot on when it comes to my personality and I have definitely made unethical decisions in the past which has made me feel terrible. Weighing up the pros and cons of a decision is ultimately based on what you want and what you desire. In fact, you might know that your decision is unethical but you make it anyway. However, I believe that it is important to always try and make ethical decisions as they take courage and they are the very essence of being human.

              <strong>Cultural Influences:</strong>
          </br>
          I was born in Wellington but when I was younger I lived in Holland for a few years. My fathers side of the family is of Dutch heritage and I would say that I have been influenced by the European culture of food, language, travel and history. However, I spent most of my time growing up in Lower Hutt. This is where I made the majority of my friends and l would consider myself to be very Kiwi. In New Zealand we are so lucky to be isolated and this gives our country a real sense of community. Being laid back, having a sense of adventure, working hard and being friendly to everyone. These are some of the cultural traits that identify me and New Zealand culture in general.

          <p> 
              <strong>Strengths and Limitations:</strong>
          </br>
          I consider myself to be loyal, genuine and curious. I have a creative and technical side plus the desire to learn. These are my strengths but there are also limitations. For example, setting expectations is something that I need to work on. I can be a little too laid back and I like things to be relaxed and easy. I have realised that setting expectations can help everyone know where you stand and it means people don’t get down. This is a work in progress for me and one that I am enjoying getting better at.     
          </p>    
          </br>
          <p> 
              <strong>Working Life:</strong>
          </br>
          I have always enjoyed the process of working with people. I like engaging with people and forming professional relationships. I have found that recognition is a very important part of getting people to work well together. People like to know they are doing a good job, or at least be acknowledged when something good has been done. It’s very easy to say, “Hey, well done fixing that problem yesterday, that was good work”. Praising is a quality I feel is a strength of mine and something I always try to bring in to a workplace.
