            Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset
          </h3>
          <h5>
            Sprint 4
          </h5><br>
          <strong>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</strong><br>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity is largely centred around forming strong neural connections in the brain. These connections are strengthened by repeated behaviour which tie in to forming strong habits. The idea that the brain can change replaced the original thinking that the brain was static and it stopped being able to develop after certain developmental periods. It is true that a child’s brain is a lot more malleable, however, that doesn’t stop as you get older. You can contain to change your brain all throughout your life.
          </p><br>
          <strong>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</strong>
          <p>
            By understanding that I can continue to learn as I get older, gives me confidence in tackling a subject I know little about. It will help reduce blocks and limitations I have within myself.
          </p><br>
          <strong>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</strong>
          <p>
            I can increase neuroplasticity by doing some of the following things: Have enough sleep. This is important so that the brain can reset brain connections that are important for memory and learning. Continue learning. Forming good habits and repetition of exercises are important to form strong neural pathways. Reduce stress. Reduce stress by doing things like exercise and meditation. This helps the brain work at a more optimum level.

          <strong>What is growth mindset and why it is relevant?</strong>
          <p>
            Growth mindset is about knowing that you can get smarter by putting the time and effort in. Therefore, anyone can achieve growth by understanding that there is no difference in the ability to learn. This leads to more confidence and higher achievement.
          </p><br>
          <strong>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</strong>
          <p>
            When reading about growth mindset, I thought that I already had a growth mindset. This definition seemed to fit me very well,
          </p><br>
          <p>
            <em>“Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts).”</em><br>
          </p><br>
          <p>
            Then I read this,
          </p><br>
          <p>
            <em>“I already have it, and I always have; People often confuse a growth mindset with being flexible or open-minded or with having a positive outlook —&nbsp;qualities they believe they’ve simply always had. My colleagues and I call this a false growth mindset. Everyone is actually a mixture of fixed and growth mindsets, and that mixture continually evolves with experience. A “pure” growth mindset doesn’t exist,&nbsp;which we have to acknowledge in order to attain the benefits we seek.”</em><br>
          </p><br>
          <p>
            Knowing the antithesis helps me know what I don’t want to do in case I start leaning towards the “fixed” growth mindset.
          </p><br>
          <strong>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</strong>
          <p>
            I will make sure that I remember that as long as I continue to do something, I will head towards my goal. I want to learn and I want to get better but I understand there are ups and downs along the way.

                Emotional Intelligence
              </h3>
              <h5>
                Sprint 3
              </h5><br>
              <strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong>
              <p>
                Emotional Intelligence or EQ, is the ability to know your own emotions and understand the emotions of others. This helps guide decision making and helps to really connect with people on an emotional level. Knowing what somebody is feeling can help us understand of what they are thinking.
              </p><br>
              <strong>How is it different to IQ?</strong>
              <p>
                IQ is about your logical reasoning, reading comprehension, mathematical and abstract thinking ability. Generally, IQ is based more on memory and the ability to learn, understand and apply information.
              </p><br>
              <strong>Why is it important?</strong>
              <p>
                Emotional intelligence is important as it helps create strong connections with people. High EQ is important when working in teams and in leadership roles. As human beings, we all share the same emotions and being able to identify other peoples emotions means that you can adjust your own behaviour and adapt emotionally to what is in front of you.

              My Learning Plan
            </h3>
            <h5>
              Sprint 2
            </h5><br>
            <strong>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</strong>
            <p>
              My long term goal is to become a developer that can work on projects remotely. I have a particular interest in working on and designing products and I would like to be involved in their original conception. Having the ability to know how to code will enable me to get hands on in the development. Specifically, application design is where I would like to end up, although I need to work on my design skills. I also really enjoy the UI/UX side of things. I am hoping to combine all these aspects in to a future career.
            </p><br>
            <strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</strong>
            <p>
              I would like to work on my communication skills, in particular, pitching an idea in order to gain support. I feel that this is a very advantageous skill to have but it can very difficult to do in a way that is clear and convincing. Being articulate and engaging is important here.
            </p><br>
            <strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations</strong>
            <p>
              I am very resourceful and I can see the big picture. I have strong interpersonal skills, empathetic and a great listener. I am resilient and I don’t give up when I face challenges. My limitations are that I can get distracted and take a lot more time than I originally anticipated to get things done. I can work for hours on end but getting started can be the hard part.
            </p><br>
            <strong>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme?</strong>
            <p>
              The key ingredient to managing my workload is to be consistent. Regular hours, with regular breaks that are bracketed with regular activities (running, music, reading). This will help me stay on track and give me some routine. I think achieving lots of little wins each day (breaking down larger goals in to smaller ones) will help motivate me.
            </p><br>
            <strong>How do you work with others?</strong>
            <p>
              Communication is key when working with others. I think being clear and confident about what I am trying to achieve as part of the team, and what my role is as a team member is very important.
            </p><br>
            <strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong>
            <p>
              When I need help, I will ask. It is easy to ask questions, via slack, phone or email. I have no problems asking for help when I need it. However, I don’t like asking for help early. I like to really explore a challenge before asking for help because from experience the answer is just around the corner if you are persistent.
            </p><br>
            <strong>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</strong>
            <p>
              I expect the facilitation team is there to help when I need it. I expect them to be reliable, accessible and honest. I like criticism as it can help me get to where I want to be faster. I expect constructive criticism from the facilitation team.
            </p><br>
            <strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</strong>
            <p>
              For foundations, my timetable is based around work in the afternoons/evenings. 1pm – 9pm. This enables me to go for a run in the morning and prepare for the day or work ahead. I also have left time in the weekends to explore a topic further. I would rather do something everyday than take complete days off.
            </p><br>
            <strong>Overall</strong>
            <p>
              In summary, my learning plan is to take advantage of all the information that is being taught at EDA and really push myself to understand as much as possible. I would like to have a portfolio by the end of the course in order to showcase my skills.

            Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration

            Sprint 1
          </h5><br>
          <p>
            <strong>Ethical Decisions:</strong><br>
            Making ethical decisions is a big part of my personality type (according to Myers Briggs). As an INFP, I have a very strong moral compass and I feel things deeply. The Myers Briggs test is pretty spot on when it comes to my personality and I have definitely made unethical decisions in the past which has made me feel terrible. Weighing up the pros and cons of a decision is ultimately based on what you want and what you desire. In fact, you might know that your decision is unethical but you make it anyway. However, I believe that it is important to always try and make ethical decisions as they take courage and they are the very essence of being human.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            <strong>Cultural Influences:</strong><br>
            I was born in Wellington but when I was younger I lived in Holland for a few years. My fathers side of the family is of Dutch heritage and I would say that I have been influenced by the European culture of food, language, travel and history. However, I spent most of my time growing up in Lower Hutt. This is where I made the majority of my friends and l would consider myself to be very Kiwi. In New Zealand we are so lucky to be isolated and this gives our country a real sense of community. Being laid back, having a sense of adventure, working hard and being friendly to everyone. These are some of the cultural traits that identify me and New Zealand culture in general.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            <strong>Strengths and Limitations:</strong><br>
            I consider myself to be loyal, genuine and curious. I have a creative and technical side plus the desire to learn. These are my strengths but there are also limitations. For example, setting expectations is something that I need to work on. I can be a little too laid back and I like things to be relaxed and easy. I have realised that setting expectations can help everyone know where you stand and it means people don’t get down. This is a work in progress for me and one that I am enjoying getting better at.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            <strong>Working Life:</strong><br>
            I have always enjoyed the process of working with people. I like engaging with people and forming professional relationships. I have found that recognition is a very important part of getting people to work well together. People like to know they are doing a good job, or at least be acknowledged when something good has been done. It’s very easy to say, “Hey, well done fixing that problem yesterday, that was good work”. Praising is a quality I feel is a strength of mine and something I always try to bring in to a workplace.
